abstract: Electromyography (EMG) has been widely used for detecting a person's hand poses and remote control applications. However, the traditional EMG-based control systems have limitations such as short controlling range, and supporting limited number of devices. There is a need for a more advanced system that can deal with the limitations while maintaining a high quality of services such as high accuracy level and controlling complex devices. Hence, we present a real-time and remote control Internet-of-Things system using EMG signals together with motion-related signals such as acceleration and angular velocity. A user wearing the Myo-band at his/her arm can remotely control devices via eight different hand gestures. The entire system was implemented and tested via two use cases of home assistant and robot arm control. The results show that the presented system could achieve a high level of accuracy e.g., 100% accuracy for simple control and 90% accuracy for complex cases. This system can be a potential approach for smart home controlling and assisting disabled people.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents an IoT-based hand gesture control system utilizing a combination of EMG and motion-related signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
