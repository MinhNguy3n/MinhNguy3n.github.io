    summary: |
      In this Specialization, I built neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learned how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and Xavier/He initialization. Additionally, I mastered these theoretical concepts, learned their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow, and tackled real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. I am familiar with the capabilities and challenges of deep learning. Thus, I am ready to take the definitive step in the world of AI and participate in the development of leading-edge technology.

## About Me

Minh Nguyen is a PhD researcher at University of Turku, currently conducting reseach in hardware accelerator architecture, embedded AI, and Embedded Systems for robotics. At the end of during his Bachelor degree, he contributed to a IoT project, where EMG-driven armband is utilzed for manipulating the joints of a MeArm robot . One of his early acemic work was submitted to the IEEE IoT 2021 Conference (accepted for notable undergraduate contribution). During 2022, he invested time for dWveloping an <em>Intelligent</em> Valve at Oras Oy (as summer trainee), where a classification model is designed for detecting outliers sensor data (e.g., leakages) near the valve. This work is available (in solictied draft version) [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360963340_Leakage_detection_in_water_supply_pipelines_using_machine_learning). Since 2023, he joined TIERS group, and proposed his doctoral topic, which focuses on exploring hardware/software co-design for accelerating AI applications.
